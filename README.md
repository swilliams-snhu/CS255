Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a client who wanted a web-based system that would help prepare kids for their driver's exams. The system would allow users to take practice exams and get driver experience with DriverPass drivers.

What did you do particularly well?
I thought that I did a good job completing my work in a timely manner. No assignments were submitted late, and I feel like the quality of my work didn't suffer from being rushed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel like I could format my documents better. I have a template that I like to follow for work, so I would adjust it to fit that.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It was very nice to have a hard copy of the transcript where the customer went over what they wanted the system to do. It's important to have notes like that because you'll rarely be able to remember what happened in a meeting months down the road.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Utilizing different UML diagrams was key in designing the system. The diagrams provided detailed outlines of everything that the system needed to do and would be invaluable if the system was ever actually developed.
